### academic life
My days are spent as a pre-doctoral intern at [The Sainsbury Laboratory](http://www.tsl.ac.uk) under Nick Talbot's. I have worked as Bio-informatics research fellow at the [Biosciences eastern and central Africa (BecA-ILRI) Hub](http://hub.africabiosciences.org/) in 2018-2019. Here, I developed experience working with unix-bash as well as R language in the analysis of short read and long read DNA-seq and RNA-seq, Phylogenetics and metabarcoding. I have worked in a molecular biology laboratory, developing skills in DNA extraction, PCR and qPCR, culturing of Fungi and Bacteria and golden gate and traditional gene cloning

My current work aims to enhancing the understanding of the diversity and virulence of pathogen races of the blast fungus *Magnaporthe orzyae* in Eastern Africa, specifically those races that infect finger millet,  to enable development of resistant varieties.

### personal life
When not consumed by the 'academic life' above, I enjoy traveling, watching movies, swimming and playing Tae-kwon-do. If you catch me at a tournament [you will often see me](/images/Taekwondo.jpeg) still in my uniform. That's just how I roll.
